  "boot-scratch: the writable region a UEFI image owns, and the address of a

  What this suite decides is the CONTRACT: that `:scratch-region` is a
  zero-arity action like every other address-producing one, and that
  `:gmir/function-address` names a function THIS MODULE declares. Where the
  region sits, how big it is and which instruction reaches a label are the
  backend's and the packager's, and are asserted there."
