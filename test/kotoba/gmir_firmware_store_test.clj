  "fwstore: the allocation that answers with an address.

  What this suite decides is the CONTRACT -- that `:uefi-alloc-region` is a
  six-operand privileged action, and that six is a width the operand tier
  already covers. The frame layout, the out-word's displacement and the
  branchless zero-on-failure belong to the backend and are asserted there;
  which SOURCE may name it belongs to kotoba-sema and to amu."
